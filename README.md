Bamazon is an interactive shopping node app that uses MySQL and Node.JS. I also used the CLI-Table 2 NPM to display the table in an easy to read fashion for the customer.

In this application, customers will view an up-to-date Bamazon inventory table and will then be allowed to choose items to purchase.
